# Chicago Police Dataset (CPD)
=======
# Project Proposal: Chicago Police Data Analysis

### 1. Working Dataset

The original datasets and documents are sourced from the Chicago Police Department (CPD), Civillian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), or the City of Chicago. However, we are building off of data that has been cleaned and matched from a [repository](https://github.com/invinst/chicago-police-data) maintained by the [Invisible Institute](https://invisible.institute/introduction). 

### 2. Research Question

With our data set we would look answer the main inferential question of if complaint rates per year differ for officers in different salary groups from the years 2005-2015.

### 3. Analysis Plan

As the CPD data set is stored in two separate files we will have to consolidate the files joining through the unique officer names. We would calculate a complaint rate per year, and bin salaries into appropriate groups to conduct a hypothesis test. 

### 4. Approach Towards Explanatory Data Analysis 

- Number of rows dropped during joining of data
- Number of complaints per year
- Number of complaints per officer
- Distribution of salary 
- Descriptive statistics of salaries

### 5. Presentation of Results

We could show the results of our analysis with a violin plot that also include the confidence interval and mean of our observations.
